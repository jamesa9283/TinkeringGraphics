# TinkeringGraphics

Matthew Shaw (ThaVoidUpdate) and I (James Arthur) discussed and produced code, we both chose different ways of attempting the problem.

The code has been adpated from Michael Scott's video tutorial.

## Instructions

The programmes are written in python 3, the code and results can be found in ColourBlindnessReport.pdf. Read the ColourBlindness.pdf, which was written in LaTeX.

##Licensing

I have used the MIT License because it allows me to keep part of my code private and it protects it from misuse that not under permission, but at the same time it allows a certain level of leeway for people to edit my code.
