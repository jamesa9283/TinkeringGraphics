# TinkeringGraphics

The GitHub repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/jamesa9283/TinkeringGraphics).

Matthew Shaw (ThaVoidUpdate) and I (James Arthur) discussed and produced code, we both chose different ways of attempting the problem.

The code snippets has been adapted from Michael Scott's video tutorial.

## Instructions

The programmes are written in python 3, the code and results can be found in ColourBlindnessReport.pdf. Read the ColourBlindness.pdf, which was written in LaTeX.

### How to run the code?
1. Download and unzip the file
